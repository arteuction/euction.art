2. **artist-signup.html** - Artist registration form (extensive form with multiple fields)

### SDG Pages (17 pages):

## Translation Approach

- Bulgarian language attribute (lang="bg")
- Proper meta tags in Bulgarian
- Consistent terminology:
  - SDG → ЦУР (Цели за устойчиво развитие)
  - NGO → НПО
  - Impact → Въздействие
  - Artworks → Творби
  - Artists → Художници

## Git Branch
